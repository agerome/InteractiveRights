    Raining Rights

    <strong class="question">
        Which rights are the most popular across history?
        <br/>
    </strong>
As countries have created new constitutions, some rights have appeared more frequently than others. For example, take the right to bear arms. At points in the late-1800s, as many as 15% of constitutions contained Second Amendment-type provisions. Now, though, only six constitutions do so.
