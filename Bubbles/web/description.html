    Constitutional Rights Around The World
</p>
<p>
    <strong class="question">
        How have constitutional rights changed over time?
        <br/>
    </strong>
    In the United States, our federal Constitution protects an array of familiar rights and freedoms, such as the freedom of expression or the right to bear
    arms. However, as international norms and priorities have shifted, many national constitutions have started to incorporate other fundamental rights, above
    and beyond those contained in the US Constitution.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Rights Interactive</strong> visualization can help you explore some of this diversity. By looking at the visualization, you can see at a glance
    whether the Brazilian Constitution protects the right to higher education, or whether the French Constitution protects the right to human dignity. We've
    broken up the various rights into six categories, so you can focus on the rights that interest you the most. You can also scroll through different years,
    and see how constitutional rights have evolved over time.

<p>
    To be sure we don't mislead you, we want to place a couple of disclaimers on this visualization.

<ul>

        <strong>
            The content in this visualization refers exclusively to rights protections in national constitutions.
            <br/>
        </strong>
        In many countries (the US included), many additional rights are also protected by state constitutions or by ordinary laws. So, just because a right is
        missing from a country's constitution doesn't mean it's not protected in that country. And, just because a country's constitution protects a right
        doesn't mean that right is actually enforced!

        <strong>Not all mentions of each right are created equal.</strong>
        Even if two constitutions both protect the same right, one constitution may protect that right in a more limited fashion than the other. If you're
        interested in exploring the details of the rights provisions in each country, the University of Texas research team has an online tool you can use to
explore the text of each constitution, and get a more nuanced view of each right ( <a href="https://www.constituteproject.org/">https://www.constituteproject.org/</a>).
