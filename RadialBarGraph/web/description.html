    The Circle of Rights

    <strong class="question">
        How have constitutional rights spread around the world?  
        <br/>
    </strong>
 In the 18th and 19th centuries, most constitutions only protected a few rights, such as the right to free speech or the right to a jury trial. Now, though, many constitutions contain a whole array of rights, including the right to health and the right to free development of one's personality.
