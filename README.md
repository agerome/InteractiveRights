# Interactive Rights

This project consists of a series of multi-touch [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketches, some of them listed below, wrapped in an HTML framework for the purpose of visualizing the evolution of constitutions around the world. The [Processing JS](http://processingjs.org/) library was used to migrate the Java-based sketches into a format that can work within a browser. Some additional JavaScript was used for the communication between the sketches and other DOM objects.
